            The increase in people staying out of state and depending on eating outside food whatever feasible is more now-a-days. Therefore it has been observed that frequently eating outside food leads to increase in health issues. Also, Those who crave for home food but unable to prepare due to several factors like insufficient time due to busy lifestyles and staying in hostels without   any resources to cook, doesn’t have any option to forcefully depend upon hotel food and street food etc. The fact that people who stay in hostels due to higher studies cannot afford healthy food on daily basis within reasonable prices. Here we can find that there are small business venders who make home food and provide mess facilities to those who are nearby their home doesn’t have any interface to let others know about their business. Thus, by using this project we are creating an interface between the people who offer home food and those who are in need and helping both the entities to come to our platform and fulfil their needs.
